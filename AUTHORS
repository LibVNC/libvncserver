*  LibVNCServer (C) 2001 Johannes E. Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>
is based on
*  Original OSXvnc (C) 2001 Dan McGuirk <mcguirk@incompleteness.net>,
which in turn is based on
*  Original Xvnc (C) 1999 AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.

Lots of improvements of this library are thanks to
* TightVNC (C) 2000-2003 Const Kaplinsky

The ZRLE compression scheme is from
* RealVNC (James "Wez" Weatherall, who helped also with regions)

The good folks from
* KRFB (I think it was Tim Jansen)
helped also a lot (some *big* bugs!).

Karl Runge provides an x11vnc, which is a much, much improved version of my
original proof-of-concept. It really deserves to replace the old version,
as it is a state-of-the-art, fast and usable program by now! However, he
maintains it and improves it still in amazing ways!

The file transfer protocol from TightVNC was implemented by Rohit Kumar.
This includes an implementation of RFB protocol version 3.7t.

Probably I forgot quite a few people sending a patch here and there, which
really made a difference. Without those, some obscure bugs still would
be unfound.
