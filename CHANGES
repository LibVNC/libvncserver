   memory leaks squashed (localtime pseudo leak is still there :-)
   small improvements for OSXvnc (still not working correctly)
   synced with TightVNC 1.2.3
   solaris compile cleanups
   many x11vnc improvements
   added backchannel, an encoding which needs special clients to pass
	arbitrary data to the client
   changes from Tim Jansen regarding multi threading and client blocking
	as well as C++ compliancy
   x11vnc can be controlled by starting again with special options if compiling
	with LOCAL_CONTROL defined
0.3
   added x11vnc, a x0rfbserver clone
   regard deferUpdateTime in processEvents, if usec<0
   initialize deferUpdateTime (memory "leak"!)
   changed command line handling (arguments are parsed and then removed)
   added very simple example: zippy
   added rfbDrawLine, rfbDrawPixel
0.2
   inserted a deferUpdate mechanism (X11 independent).
   removed deletion of requestedRegion
   added rfbLoadConsoleFont
   fixed font colour handling.
   added rfbSelectBox
   added rfbDrawCharWithClip to allow for clipping and a background colour.
   fixed font colours
   added rfbFillRect
   added IO function to check password.
   rfbNewClient now sets the socket in the fd_set (for the select() call)
   when compiling the library with HAVE_PTHREADS and an application
	which includes "rfb.h" without, the structures got mixed up.
	So, the pthreads section is now always at the end, and also
	you get a linker error for rfbInitServer when using two different
	pthread setups.
   fixed two deadlocks: when setting a cursor and when using CopyRect
   fixed CopyRect when copying modified regions (they lost the modified
	 property)
   WIN32 target compiles and works for example :-)
   fixed CopyRect (was using the wrong order of rectangles...)
   	 should also work with pthreads, because copyrects are
	 always sent immediately (so that two consecutive copy rects
	 cannot conflict).
   changed rfbUndrawCursor(rfbClientPtr) to (rfbScreenInfoPtr), because
   	   this makes more sense!
   flag backgroundLoop in rfbScreenInfo (if having pthreads)
   CopyRect & CopyRegion were implemented.
	if you use a rfbDoCopyR* function, it copies the data in the
	framebuffer. If you prefer to do that yourself, use rfbScheduleCopyR*
	instead; this doesn't modify the frameBuffer.
   added flag to optionally not send XCursor updates, but only RichCursor,
	or if that is not possible, fall back to server side cursor.
	This is useful if your cursor has many nice colours.
   fixed java viewer on server side:
	SendCursorUpdate would send data even before the client pixel format
	was set, but the java applet doesn't like the server's format.
   fixed two pthread issues:
	rfbSendFramebuffer was sent by a ProcessClientMessage function
	(unprotected by updateMutex).
	cursor coordinates were set without protection by cursorMutex
   source is now equivalent to TridiaVNC 1.2.1
   pthreads now work (use iterators!)
   cursors are supported (rfbSetCursor automatically undraws cursor)
   support for 3 bytes/pixel (slow!)
   server side colourmap support
   fixed rfbCloseClient not to close the connection (pthreads!)
	this is done lazily (and with proper signalling).
   cleaned up mac.c (from original OSXvnc); now compiles (untested!)
   compiles cleanly on Linux, IRIX, BSD, Apple (Darwin)
   fixed prototypes
0.1
   rewrote API to use pseudo-methods instead of required functions.
   lots of clean up.
   Example can show symbols now.
   All encodings
   HTTP
