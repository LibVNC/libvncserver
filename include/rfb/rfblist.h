/**
 * @file Classic doubly-link circular list implementation.
 * For real usage examples of the linked list, see the file test/list.c
 *
 * Example:
 * We need to keep a list of struct foo in the parent struct bar, i.e. what
 * we want is something like this.
 *
 *     struct bar {
 *          ...
 *          struct foo *list_of_foos; -----> struct foo {}, struct foo {}, struct foo{}
 *          ...
 *     }
 *
 * We need one list head in bar and a list element in all list_of_foos (both are of
 * data type 'struct rfb_list').
 *
 *     struct bar {
 *          ...
 *          struct rfb_list list_of_foos;
 *          ...
 *     }
 *
 *     struct foo {
 *          ...
 *          struct rfb_list entry;
 *          ...
 *     }
 *
 * Now we initialize the list head:
 *
 *     struct bar bar;
 *     ...
 *     rfb_list_init(&bar.list_of_foos);
 *
 * Then we create the first element and add it to this list:
 *
 *     struct foo *foo = malloc(...);
 *     ....
 *     rfb_list_add(&foo->entry, &bar.list_of_foos);
 *
 * Repeat the above for each element you want to add to the list. Deleting
 * works with the element itself.
 *      rfb_list_del(&foo->entry);
 *      free(foo);
 *
 * Note: calling rfb_list_del(&bar.list_of_foos) will set bar.list_of_foos to an empty
 * list again.
 *
 * Looping through the list requires a 'struct foo' as iterator and the
 * name of the field the subnodes use.
 *
 * struct foo *iterator;
 * rfb_list_for_each_entry(iterator, &bar.list_of_foos, entry) {
 *      if (iterator->something == ...)
 *             ...
 * }
 *
 * Note: You must not call rfb_list_del() on the iterator if you continue the
 * loop. You need to run the safe for-each loop instead:
 *
 * struct foo *iterator, *next;
 * rfb_list_for_each_entry_safe(iterator, next, &bar.list_of_foos, entry) {
 *      if (...)
 *              rfb_list_del(&iterator->entry);
 * }
 *
 */
