    <h1>LibVNCServer</h1>

<br>

    If you have problems updating with CVS, here is a <a href=LibVNCServer-0.7pre.tar.gz>preliminary version</a>. If you are looking for more information
    on Karl's wonderful x11vnc, either download it
    <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32584>here</a>, or
    look at <a href=http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/>x11vnc's homepage</a>.

    <h2> News </h2>
    <strong>2004/09/14</strong> Added
    <a href=http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/success.html>
    Success stories</a>.
<p>
    <strong>2004/09/07</strong> The API was cleaned up. The structures and functions now have a prefix (mostly "rfb", sometimes "zrle" or "sra") in order not to clutter the namespace, while the structure's members don't need such a prefix.
<p>
    <strong>2004/08/17</strong> I finally came around to fix mouse behaviour in QEMU's VNC frontend for Windows 98. Please find the patch <a href=qemu/>here</a>. If mouse behaves strangely, try to wiggle the pointer to a free spot on the desktop, hit Ctrl+Shift and release them. After that, the mouse should behave nicely.
<p>
    <strong>2004/06/07</strong> After silently being added almost a year ago, libvncclient's API was modified for real use, and three examples were added: ppmtest (a very simple demo), SDLvncviewer, and vnc2mpg (which lets you record your VNC session to a movie). Automated regression tests of the libraries are planned.
<p>
    <strong>2004/06/02</strong> <a href=http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/>x11vnc</a>-0.6.1 was released! This reflects the long way the original, small example has gone, improved in many possible ways and having a broad user base.
<p>
    <strong>2004/05/29</strong> Some <a href=qemu/>patches</a> were created for <a href=http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/>QEMU</a>, a FAST! emulator by Fabrice Bellard, to control those sessions with a vncviewer.
<p>
    <strong>2004/02/29</strong> LibVNCServer is listed as a project using <a href=http://valgrind.kde.org/>Valgrind</a>!
<p>
    <strong>2003/11/07</strong> Version 0.6 is out! x11vnc performance boosts! You no longer need a c++ compiler in order to have ZRLE coding! LinuxVNC was added (This is to the text console what x11vnc is to X11)!
<p>
    <strong>2003/02/21</strong> rdp2vnc is in rdesktop's CVS.
<p>
    <strong>2003/02/19</strong> A preliminary patch for rdesktop (CVS) to make
rdp2vnc, a translator from Windows Terminal Server's protocol to VNC's protocol,
is <a href=rdesktop-cvs+vnc.diff.gz>available</a>. It needs a new version of
libvncserver; try CVS until I release 0.6.
<p>
    <strong>2003/02/09</strong> Version 0.5 is out! Features include autoconf based configure, rpm package (YMMV), cleanup of directory structure, NEW x11vnc! ZRLE encoding! HTTP tunnelling through LibVNCServer's HTTP support! Many bug fixes!
<p>
    <strong>2002/07/28</strong> Version 0.4 is out! Biggest feature: NewFB encoding. Quite a few bugfixes also (Thanks to all!).
<p>
    <strong>2001/12/14</strong> A new version of
      <a href=http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libvncserver/rdesktop-1.1.0+vnc-0.2.tar.gz>rdesktop+vnc</a> is available!
      (Includes support for other platforms keyboard mapping with plain rdesktop!)
<p>
    <strong>2001/10/23</strong> Added a link to my homepage at the end.
<p>
    <strong>2001/10/18</strong> I released the rdp2vnc extensions as well as
    patches for general keyboard handling, working inside Xvnc and
    process_text2 (the famous "font:" error) to rdesktop. Please find it on
    the <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32584>
      download page</a>.
<p>
    <strong>2001/10/13</strong> A snapshot of 
    <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32584>
	LibVNCServer</a> and 
    <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32584>
	RDP2VNC</a>
    is now available. You can also download the
    <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32584>
	diff</a> against rdesktop-1.1.0.
    rdp2vnc also contains the patches for keyboards other than PC keyboards,
    and you can specify "-k fr" again.

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    If you don't know VNC, have a look at
 <a href=http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/>the original VNC</a> or at
 <a href=http://www.tridiavnc.com/>Tridia VNC</a>, who also have commercial
 support for it.

<p>

    Now that you know what it is, maybe you want to make your own server.
    If this is not the case, you can ignore the rest of this page an go on
    surfing the internet.

<p>

    Now that you want to make a VNC server, that is, a server which speaks
    the RFB protocol, you can download this library from
    <a href=http://sf.net/projects/libvncserver/>sourceforge</a>.

<p>

    The simplest server looks like this:<br><br>

<pre>
#include &lt;rfb/rfb.h&gt;

int main(int argc,char** argv)
{
  rfbScreenInfoPtr server=rfbGetScreen(&argc,argv,400,300,8,3,4);
  server->frameBuffer=malloc(400*300*4);
  rfbInitServer(server);
  rfbRunEventLoop(server,-1,FALSE);
  return(0);
}

</pre>

    This sample creates a 400x300 frame buffer in true colour. There are
    4 bytes per pixel, because 3 (which are only used instead of all 4) is
    such an odd number. Then the server is initialized and a blocking event
    loop is started.

<p>
    Of course, this program only shows rubbish (whatever is in the frame
    buffer you malloc'd), but it proves that writing a server can be
    very easy.

<p>
    For details (especially if you want to write a real server) look into the
    provided examples, pnmshow.c and example.c, and into the README. You find
    there documentation for much more complicated servers.

    LibVNCServer  is an adapted
 <a href=http://www.redstonesoftware.com/vnc.html>OSXvnc-server</a> by
 <a href=mailto:mcguirk@incompleteness.net>Dan McGuirk</a>,
 which is in turn an adapted original
 <a href=http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/>Xvnc</a>.
<p>
 I use it to to drive a
<strong>Windows Terminal Server (RDP) to RFB converter</strong> with it.
 Much work has been done to make
 <a href=http://www.rdesktop.org/>rdesktop</a>
 a good X client to Windows Terminal Services (both NT and 2000, see
 <a href=http://bibl4.oru.se/projects/rdesktop/>rdesktop patches</a>).
 Previous work was done by <a href=mailto:tme23@cam.ac.uk>Tim Edmonds</a>
 who has set up such a converter named
 <a href=http://www-lce.eng.cam.ac.uk/~tme23/vdesktop/>vdesktop</a>
 including a single client server and a multi client server, rdp2vnc.
 Unfortunately he used the example code from rfbcounter, which can encode only
 RRE, which is not a good compression.
<p>
 <a href=http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/success.html>Other people</a>
 have used this library as well.
