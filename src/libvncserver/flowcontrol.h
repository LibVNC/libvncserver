/*
 * This code implements congestion control in the same manner as TCP, in order
 * to avoid excessive latency in the transport.  This is needed because "buffer
 * bloat" is unfortunately still a very real problem.
 *
 * The basic principle is that described in RFC 5681 (TCP Congestion Control),
 * with the addition of using the TCP Vegas algorithm.  The reason we use Vegas
 * is that we run on top of a reliable transport, so we need a latency-based
 * algorithm rather than a loss-based one.  There is also a lot of
 * interpolation in our algorithm, because our measurements have poor
 * granularity.
 *
 * We use a simplistic form of slow start in order to ramp up quickly from an
 * idle state.  We do not have any persistent threshold, though, as there is
 * too much noise for it to be reliable.
