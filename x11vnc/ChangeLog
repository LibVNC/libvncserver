	  moved/resized and just show a wireframe. -wirecopyrect means to
	  apply rfbDoCopyRegion to the detected move as well.
	* debugging switches for X events and X damage: debug_xevents

	* improvements to -help text.

From Karl (x11vnc's father) on Apr 2, 2003:
	
New option -nocursor to not display the vncviewer local cursor if user
does not want it (also caused some problems with older vncviewers)

New option -mouse to show the position of the X server mouse (i.e. lagged
from the user's vnc cursor position).  Also: -mouseX will try to show
the a different cursor (X) when on the root background.

New option -many to wait for more connections rather than exiting when
the first client(s) disconnect.

New option -flashcmap to try to follow installed colormaps under 8bpp
indexed color as pointer is moved.

New option -nap to watch for low activity and throttle down the polling
rate.  Useful on shared machines to keep the load down.

Experimental option -id <windowid> to show just that window and not
the whole display.  Some remaining bugs and inconvenient behavior...
(e.g. new toplevels can be unseen)

Fixed bug on multi-headed machines where the screen number was being
ignored in a number of places.

Fixed bug wrt connect_once mode.  Now just refuses new clients unless
shared rather than terminating all clients.

Try to follow changing default colormap under 8bpp indexed color
as color cells are added.

Needed to pick up HAVE_LIBPTHREAD from autoconf.

defined a select() macro for usleep() since usleep is not always thread
safe.

Catch and exit on errors in the shm setup work (XShmCreateImage, shmget,...)
and moved the creation and removal work to separate utility functions.

Added signal and X error handlers to try to clean out the shm objects
before exiting on interrupt, etc.

Improved performance a bit on the memcmp() in scan_display() by checking
the whole line first.

Added a workaround when threaded where libvncserver may disconnect too
early if it does not hear from a client (a small heartbeat is sent).
This may not be needed any longer.

If -desktop has not been prescribed, try to choose a title based on DISPLAY
and the hostname (and window name under -id).
